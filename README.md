* Developed double track Chassis motion model with 5 degree of freedom(roll, pitch, yaw dynamics and both longitudinal and lateral load transfer) and Tyre-force model with combined forces based on the friction ellipse in Simulink.
* Formulated yaw stability control promlem, utilized 3 control strategies of Active chassis control which are Active braking direct yaw moment control, Active front wheels steering control and Integrated active steering and direct yaw moment control rspecifically.
* Verified 9 dof vehicle dynamics characteristics in Double-Lane change maneuver, compared and discussed 3 control strategies of Active chassis control system.
